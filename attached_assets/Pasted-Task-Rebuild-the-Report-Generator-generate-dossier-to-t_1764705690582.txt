Task: Rebuild the Report Generator (generate_dossier) to tell a coherent story. Transition from "Forensic Analyst" (The Problem) to "Success Coach" (The Solution).

1. Section A: The Forensic Audit (The "Crime Scene")

Visual Style: "Evidence Folder" / "Redacted File".

Content:

The Verdict: A large stamp: "INVISIBLE" (Red) or "DETECTED" (Green).

The Suspect Lineup: Show the Top 3 Competitors identified by the Scraper.

The "Smoking Gun": Use Pinecone to find the exact text the competitor uses that the client lacks.

Example: "Competitor 'Coastal Roofing' mentions 'Hurricane Insurance Claims' 12 times. You mention it 0 times."

2. Section B: The "Coach's Playbook" (The 30-Day Plan)

Tone: Shift from analytical to motivational and prescriptive.

Logic: Instead of generic tasks ("Fix SEO"), use the Gap Analysis to write the tasks dynamically.

Structure (The 4-Week Sprint):

Week 1: Triage & Patching (The "Stop the Bleeding" Phase)

Focus: Technical fixes found in the scan (Schema, Sitemap, Robots.txt).

Narrative: "Before we attack, we must fix the foundation. Coastal Roofing has perfect Schema. We need to match that by Friday."

Week 2: The Content Counter-Attack (The "Gap Closure" Phase)

Focus: Creating the missing pages identified by Pinecone.

Narrative: "The Detective found a gap in 'Emergency Services'. Your job this week is to launch the 'Emergency' landing page using the text we generated."

Week 3: Authority & Signals (The "Reputation" Phase)

Focus: Citations and Social Proof (from the 'Wiretap' engine).

Narrative: "We need to get you cited. Submit your business to these 3 directories where your competitor is listed but you are not."

Week 4: The Re-Scan (The "Weigh-In" Phase)

Focus: Monitoring and adjustment.

Narrative: "We will re-run the Private Eye scan on Day 30 to measure your visibility lift."

3. The "Fabricator" Integration:

Next to each "Weekly Task" in the PDF/Dashboard, add a "Get Tools" link.

Week 1 Link: Downloads the Schema.json.

Week 2 Link: Downloads the Landing_Page_Template.zip.

4. Technical Execution:

Use the LLM to write the "Coaching Voice" text based on the specific Pinecone data.

Ensure the PDF output looks clean, professional, and high-value (like a $2,000 consulting report).
