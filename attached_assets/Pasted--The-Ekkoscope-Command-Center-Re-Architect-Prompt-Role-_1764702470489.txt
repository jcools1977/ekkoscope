🚀 The "Ekkoscope Command Center" Re-Architect Prompt
Role: You are a Senior Frontend Architect and UI/UX Designer specializing in high-frequency trading terminals and military-grade dashboards.

Objective: Completely rebuild the Mission Control dashboard. The current version looks like a static PDF report. The new version must feel like a Live Tactical Command Center. The user should feel anxiety about their current status and adrenaline when they click "Fix."

1. The Design Language: "Tactical Stealth"
Theme: "Midnight Protocol" (Deepest Navy/Black: #0B0C15 to #1A1D2D).

Texture: Use Glassmorphism heavily. Panels should look like floating glass panes with subtle white borders (border-white/10) and background blur.

Typography: Use a strict Monospace font (e.g., JetBrains Mono or Roboto Mono) for ALL numbers and data points. It must look calculated.

Color Logic:

Red (Critical): Use neon red (#FF4444) for threats, leaks, and competitor dominance. Add a "slow pulse" animation to these elements.

Green (Growth): Use cyber green (#00FF9D) only for projected gains and the "Deploy" button.

Grey (The Ghost): Use dotted grey lines for "Market Leader" benchmarks.

2. Component Specifications (The "Bento Grid" Layout)
A. Top Bar: The "Bleed" Ticker

Create a slim, full-width status bar at the very top.

Content: A scrolling ticker or static alert: ⚠ CRITICAL ALERT: ESTIMATED REVENUE LEAK: -$8.29 / HOUR.

Animation: The dollar amount should tick up incrementally every few seconds. This creates immediate psychological urgency.

B. Main Graph: The "Gap Analysis" Simulator (Center/Left)

Current Issue: The graph is a flat line at 0%. This is boring.

New Requirement: Implement a Recharts Area Chart with Two Lines:

The "Market Leader" Line (Top): A dotted grey line hovering at 80-90% visibility. Label: "Competitor Benchmark (Coastal Roofing)".

The "User" Line (Bottom): The user's current 0% line.

The Kill Shot: Shade the area between these two lines in a gradient Red. Label this zone: "MISSED REVENUE OPPORTUNITY".

Interaction: When the user toggles switches in the "Simulator" (see below), animate a Third Line (Green) shooting up from the bottom to meet the top line.

C. The "Tactical Countermeasures" Panel (Right Column)

Replace the generic "Action Simulator" list.

Create a list of "High-Value Targets" (e.g., "Inject Schema," "Fix Meta Tags").

UI: Each item gets a "Toggle Switch."

Micro-Interaction: When a user toggles a switch:

The Green Line on the main graph animates upward.

A floating badge appears: "+$450/mo Value Unlocked".

The "Projected Score" widget glows green.

D. The "Competitor Threat" Radar (Bottom Left)

Current Issue: It says "None / 0%".

New Requirement: Hard-code/Mock data to show "Coastal Roofing" at 28% Market Share.

Visual: Use a "Progress Bar" comparison.

Top Bar (Red): "Coastal Roofing: 28% [▲ Trending Up]"

Bottom Bar (Green): "You: 0% [▼ Critical]"

Goal: Visually highlight the massive gap they need to close.

E. The "Nuclear Launch" Console (The $1,188 Feature)

Replace the small green "Activate" button with a full-width "Deployment Console" at the bottom.

Visuals: It should look like a developer terminal. Dark background, green text.

Content: List the agents ready to deploy: [READY] SchemaBot, [READY] MetaFixer, [READY] CodePatch v2.

Button: A large, pulsing button labeled: "DEPLOY RESOLUTION AGENTS".

Action: Clicking this opens a modal offering 3 delivery methods:

Copy Code (Clipboard icon)

Download Patch Kit (Zip file icon - Use jszip to generate this real-time)

GitHub PR (GitHub icon - Mocked for now).

3. Technical Constraints
Framework: React + Tailwind CSS.

Charts: Use recharts for the responsive graphs.

Animations: Use framer-motion for the "Gap Fill" animation and the "Revenue Leak" ticker.

Responsiveness: On mobile, stack the Bento Grid vertically but keep the "Revenue Leak" ticker sticky at the top.

Execution: Build this now. Do not ask for clarification. Prioritize the "Gap Analysis" graph and the "Revenue Leak" ticker visual.
