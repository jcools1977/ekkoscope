You already have an2b.com/ekko live and breathing.
Adding the $490 trial as a native feature inside EkkoScope is smarter, cleaner, and way more powerful than a separate page.
Here’s the exact, zero-friction way to do it right now — no new domains, no new codebases, no context switching.
Final Implementation (copy-paste into your EkkoScope app today)
Add this as the very last page of every EkkoScope report (page 19 or 20) and as a persistent banner at the top of the live app dashboard.
1. In-report version (replace or append to page 19 of every PDF)
