We are going to pivot the design language from "Noir Detective" to "Tier-1 Strategy Consulting" (think McKinsey meets Palantir). The document should look like something a CEO pays $50k for.

Here is the complete Professional Overhaul Plan.

1. The New "System Prompt" (The Voice) 🧠
Replace your current "Detective" prompt in the backend with this.

Copy/Paste into Replit:

System Role: You are a Senior Market Intelligence Analyst for a high-end strategic consulting firm. You are generating a "Threat Assessment" for a business client.

Tone Guidelines:

Objective & Direct: Do not use metaphors ("Crime Scene", "Smoking Gun"). Use precise business terminology.

High-Stakes: Frame low visibility not as a "mistake," but as a "critical vulnerability" and "revenue risk."

Action-Oriented: Every insight must lead to a strategic directive.

Vocabulary Swap Protocol:

Instead of "Suspects" → Use "Market Incumbents" or "Competitive Threats".

Instead of "Evidence" → Use "Intelligence Artifacts" or "Verified Data Points".

Instead of "Solving the Crime" → Use "Remediation Strategy" or "Gap Closure Protocol".

Instead of "Invisible" → Use "Zero-Signal Detected".

Output Goal: The user should read this and feel they are receiving a classified briefing on their market position.

2. The Document Visual Overhaul (The Look) 📄
We are ditching the "File Folder" look for a "Swiss Style" layout (Clean grids, heavy typography, plenty of whitespace).

The New Structure (PDF Layout):

Page 1: The Executive Briefing (The "BLUF")
Header: Minimalist. Logo top left. "CONFIDENTIAL MARKET BRIEF" top right (Small, grey, all caps).

The Hero Metric: A massive, clean number for Visibility Score.

Visual: If 0%, show a large Red Circle with "0%" inside. Label: "Current Market Penetration".

The Executive Summary: A 3-bullet narrative.

"Critical Risk: A-D Metal Roofing currently holds 0% Share of Voice in AI-mediated search."

"Primary Threat: Competitor 'Coastal Roofing' commands 28% market share."

"Strategic Imperative: Immediate deployment of 'Emergency' landing pages is required to intercept competitor traffic."

Page 2: The Threat Landscape (The Data)
Title: "Competitive Vector Analysis"

The Chart: A clean Bar Chart comparing Client vs. Competitors.

The Insight Table:

Column 1: Adversary (Competitor Name).

Column 2: Dominance (% Share).

Column 3: Key Weapon (e.g., "They rank for 'Emergency Repair'").

Page 3: Semantic Gap Intelligence (The "Why")
Title: "Content Gap Forensics"

Layout: Two columns: "Competitor Signal" vs. "Your Signal".

Competitor Side (Red BG): Display the raw text snippet from their site. "Service within 1 hour."

Your Side (Grey BG): "No matching signal detected."

The Analyst Note: "Observation: Competitor signals 'Speed' and 'Urgency'. Your content signals 'General Availability'. This semantic mismatch causes AI models to deprecate your ranking for emergency queries."

Page 4: The Remediation Protocol (The Plan)
Title: "30-Day Tactical Roadmap"

Visual: A vertical Timeline (Gantt Chart style).

Phase 1 (Wk 1): Infrastructure Hardening. (Schema, Meta Tags).

Phase 2 (Wk 2): Asset Deployment. (Launch Emergency Page).

Phase 3 (Wk 3): Authority Signals. (Citations).

Call to Action: A clean link at the bottom: "Access Mission Control to Deploy Assets".

3. The Implementation Prompt (For Replit)
Copy/Paste this to update the PDF Generator:

Task: Overhaul the PDF Report generation to be "Corporate Professional."

Remove all "Noir" Branding: Delete "Classified Stamp," "Folder" backgrounds, and "Detective" icons.

New Aesthetic:

Font: Inter or Helvetica (Clean Sans-Serif).

Colors: Deep Navy (#0F172A), Slate Grey (#64748B), and Alert Red (#EF4444) for risks. No neon green.

Layout: Use a grid system. Borders should be thin (1px solid #E2E8F0).

Data Presentation:

Render the "Competitive Landscape" as a clean Table with "Share of Voice" bars.

Render the "Semantic Gaps" as a side-by-side comparison box called "Signal Analysis."

Header/Footer:

Header: "Ekkoscope Intelligence | Client: [Name] | Date: [Date]"

Footer: "CONFIDENTIAL - FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY."

Why this works better
When a business owner sees a "Detective File," they think, "Cute marketing." When they see a "Threat Assessment" with "Remediation Protocols," they think, "I need to fix this before my board/partner sees it."

It shifts the emotion from Amusement to Professional Anxiety. That is where the budget opens up.
